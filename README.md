# dabbler
Website that provides beer recommendations based on beerology and user preferences

This website aims to solve the central problem of the saturated microbrew market in Minnesota, in the United States. With so many options, it is difficult to select a beer one will like from a brewery let alone remember past selections. 

Dabbler will be built to help users select drinks from breweries they will likely enjoy based on their preferences. It will also remember which breweries the user has attended, and which drinks they enjoyed.

This project is small-scale and highly localized, but may scale up if users become engaged with the website.

Happy dabbling!
